		<p>A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules (syntax)for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. </p>		
		<p>Programming languages can be used to create computer programs. </p>	
		<p>The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.</p>	
		<p1 style="font-size:120%" >You eventually need to convert your program into machine language so that the computer can understand it. There are two ways to do this:</p1>	
		<p>1- Compile the program.</p>	
		<p>2– Interpret the program.</p>	
		<p1 style="font-size:120%">Compile is to transform a program written in a high-level programming language from source code into object code.</p1>
		<p>• This can be done by using a tool called compiler. it can read the whole source code and translates it into a complete machine code program to perform the required tasks which is output as a new file.</p>	
		<p>Interpreter is a program that executes instructions written in a high-level language. An interpreter reads the source code one instruction or line at a time, converts this line into machine code and executes it.</p>	
		<p>Computer programming is the process of writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.This source code is written in a programming language like C++, JAVA, Perl etc.</p>	
		<p>A programmer is someone who writes computer program. Computer programmers write, test, and maintain programs or software that tell the computer what to do.</p>	
		<p1 style="font-size:120%">The chosen programming language provides a set of basic matters to draw upon during the program’s creation process and a set of rules that enable you to handle information and organize it to perform the required work.</p1>
		<p>1) Information and storage: Information in current digital devices is stored as numbers according to the binary counting system (i.e. dependent on 0 and 1). Generally speaking, modern processors do not deal with single bits, but rather with combinations of bits.</p>
		<p>2) Orders and organizing their conduct: The programmer performs operations on information units such as storing, reading and comparing them and calculations can also be performed on them, and the operations follow the specific rules for the language. The programming language has another role, which is to control the organization of conducting operations, as it directs the implementation of its steps in the same sequence as it was written by the programmer.</p>
		<p>3) Special design: Each language has a special design in terms of handling data, and in terms of the methods and facilities that the language provides to deal with a specific problem. Programming languages can be classified in terms of how to build programs into procedural languages (basic, Fortran) which are serial languages, the basis of which they are built is the required procedures that require data and variables.</p>
